# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Introduction to Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It develops due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain's substantia nigra, which leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. The most common symptoms include:

Tremors: Involuntary shaking or trembling, often starting in the hands.
Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement, making everyday activities more difficult and time-consuming.
Rigidity: Stiffness in the muscles, causing discomfort and reduced range of motion.
Postural Instability: Difficulty in maintaining balance, increasing the risk of falls.
Non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances are also common. Parkinson's disease affects millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging population. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective management and treatment.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Parkinson's Disease Detection
What is a Multilayer Perceptron?
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons. It is a powerful and versatile tool in the field of machine learning, capable of modeling complex relationships in data. An MLP typically includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of neurons that are connected to the neurons in the preceding and succeeding layers.

Advantages of Using MLP for Disease Detection
High Accuracy: MLPs can achieve high levels of accuracy in classification tasks, making them ideal for detecting patterns associated with Parkinson's disease from various types of data such as motor assessments and speech recordings.

Nonlinear Modeling: MLPs can model complex, nonlinear relationships between input features, which is essential for capturing the subtle and varied manifestations of Parkinson's disease.

Feature Extraction: They have the capability to automatically learn and extract relevant features from raw data, reducing the need for extensive manual feature engineering.

Scalability: MLPs can be scaled up by adding more layers and neurons, which allows them to handle large and complex datasets effectively.

Generalization: With proper training and regularization techniques, MLPs can generalize well to new, unseen data, making them robust against overfitting.

Flexibility: MLPs can be applied to various types of data, including time-series data, images, and more, making them versatile tools for detecting Parkinson's disease from different diagnostic tests and assessments.

Integration with Other Techniques: MLPs can be integrated with other machine learning techniques such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction to enhance performance and reduce computational complexity.

By leveraging the strengths of MLPs, this project aims to provide an efficient and accurate tool for the early detection of Parkinson's disease, contributing to better patient outcomes and advancing the field of medical diagnostics.
