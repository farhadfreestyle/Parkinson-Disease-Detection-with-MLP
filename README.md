# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Introduction to Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement. It develops due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain's substantia nigra, which leads to a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. The most common symptoms include:

Tremors: Involuntary shaking or trembling, often starting in the hands.
Bradykinesia: Slowness of movement, making everyday activities more difficult and time-consuming.
Rigidity: Stiffness in the muscles, causing discomfort and reduced range of motion.
Postural Instability: Difficulty in maintaining balance, increasing the risk of falls.
Non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and sleep disturbances are also common. Parkinson's disease affects millions of people worldwide, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging population. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective management and treatment.

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for Parkinson's Disease Detection
What is a Multilayer Perceptron?
A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of multiple layers of neurons. It is a powerful and versatile tool in the field of machine learning, capable of modeling complex relationships in data. An MLP typically includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer consists of neurons that are connected to the neurons in the preceding and succeeding layers.


In this work, the dataset is small which makes it difficult to train the model deeply therefore in test dataset the accuracy is around 90%
